# adaline-classifier
In this project we try to classify with adaline neural network.
In adaline1.py the data is seperatable and we can see that the network can classify that and we get test accuracy of 100%.
In adaline2.py we use the same data in adaline1.py, but we first standardize the data and then teach the network. At the result we see that the seperation line is placed better than the last part.
In adaline3.py we use data that is not seperatable. The network places the seperation line, somehow we get the best train accuracy. In works better in such data in camparison with perceptron.
